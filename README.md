## Temp(o)

https://temp-o.netlify.app/#/

Get todays temp around the world and some nice tunes while you're at it. Temp(o) is a front end website which collects data from openweathermap.org/. Currently users can type in a city and get the weather along with two suggested songs for the day based off the weather description (Clouds, Rain, Clear etc..). 

Temp(o) was made with React (hooks) and React styled components.

## What's to come? 

Temp(o) intends to have some new features soon! 

• Login and Signup for users to have the ability to bookmark previsouly searched locations.   
• Address suggestions when searching for a location.   
• Using a third party database for songs instead of locally storing song info.
